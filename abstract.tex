Gridcoin [6] is a decentralized, open source cryptocurrency which performs transactions without the need for a central issuing authority. Gridcoin securely rewards volunteer distributed computing performed on the BOINC [5] platform. BOINC is a volunteer computing grid which combines the processing power of individual users for the purposes of scientific research. The platform is free, open source, and already home to numerous independent projects with such diverse goals as curing cancer/AIDS/Ebola/malaria, mapping the Milky Way galaxy, discovering record prime numbers, and many others [11-20]. Since its creation in the early 2000s, the BOINC network has maintained an active userbase consisting of hundreds of thousands of participants from around the globe. Gridcoin was created in part to incentivize and further grow the BOINC userbase by rewarding calculations performed on the network.

Though heavily based on Bitcoin, Gridcoin distinguishes itself in its "environmentally friendly" method of securing the network. Instead of using Proof of Work, which hinges on the wasteful task of inverting a hash function, Gridcoin implements the novel approach of Proof of Stake [2] linked to Distributed Proof of Research [3], developed specifically for Gridcoin. In particular, Proof of Research replaces hash function inversion, which has no value outside of the network which it secures, with useful scientific computation on the BOINC network. Consistent with Gridcoin's decentralized structure, selection of which scientific projects to include in Proof of Research is carried out using a voting mechanism embedded in the blockchain. This approach challenges the traditional "top-down" approach to funding science, which is heavily biased towards the priorities of governments and private corporations, and ushers in the new and exciting prospect of scientific research directed by the goals and interests of a diverse international community.
